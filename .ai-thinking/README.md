# .ai-thinking Directory

This directory contains AI-generated analysis, documentation, and planning materials for the UPPR project.

## Purpose

These files are **NOT version-controlled** (see `.gitignore`). They serve as:
- Project architecture documentation
- Migration planning and checklists  
- Technical research and analysis
- Development notes and decisions

## Contents

1. **project-overview.md** - Complete project architecture and tech stack overview
2. **nextjs-navigation-guide.md** - Latest Next.js 16 navigation patterns and migration guide
3. **migration-checklist.md** - Step-by-step checklist for upgrading to Next.js 16
4. **uppr-navigation-examples.md** - Code examples for migrating UPPR components
5. **nextjs-file-upload-limitations.md** - Serverless limitations and solutions for file uploads
6. **runtime-article-creation-architecture.md** - Architecture for creating articles dynamically

## Why Not Version Controlled?

- These are working notes and analysis documents
- They may contain experimental ideas or drafts
- They're project-specific to this development session
- They can be regenerated or updated as needed
- They're meant for local reference only

## Usage

These files are kept locally on your DigitalOcean droplet for reference during development. They help maintain context across work sessions and can be updated as the project evolves.
