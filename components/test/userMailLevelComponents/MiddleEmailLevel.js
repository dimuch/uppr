        Here are the 4 habits you need to change to become a really effective emailer.
      </p>


      <h4>
        Habit #1. Stop beating about the bush
      </h4>
      <p>
        Get straight to the point. Seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one needs pointless introductory phrases or formalities that don't add value but add extra symbols to your
        email. You do not need to start your email with "I am writing just to let you know…", I want to inform you…" ,
        "A short reminder about..." and the like. It is an email after all, not a high school essay. As they say in
        Hollywood — cut to the chase.
      </p>


      <h4>
        Habit #2. Avoid relic, passive phrases
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It has come to my attention that...</li>
        <li>Please (kindly) be informed/advised…</li>
        <li>Please find attached…</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These phrases sound too detached and far from adding sincerity to your message. So don't waste your reader's
        time and screen space; use more modern wording, and make reading your message easy by being clear, efficient,
        and enjoyable.
      </p>

        "The key is to write in a natural style as if you are having a conversation," says Shirley Taylor, the author of
        Model Business Letters, Emails and Other Business Documents.

      <h4>
        Habit #3. Refocus.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Start with them, not with yourself. Turn the flashlight on your reader to create a sound

          Reader eXperience (RX).
        </a>
        Everyone is interested in themselves and cares about their goals and dreams. Your readers, as well. So shift
        your focus. Write so that the reader 1. understands you well; 2. feels important for you. These two points are a
        guarantee that your emails will be replied to.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Habit #4. Avoid long formal language
      </h4>
      <p>
        The expansion of social networks to business practices made them more personalised, customised, and, therefore,
        informal. Compare: 'help' and 'assistance', or 'get' and 'receive or obtain'. Both 'help' and ‘get' are much
        shorter words and mean the same as their equivalents. The same story is with ‘need’ and ‘require.' Informal
        language is not just shorter but also easier to read and perceived.
