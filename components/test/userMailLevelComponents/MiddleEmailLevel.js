        Here are the 4 habits you need to change to become a really effective emailer.
      </p>


      <h4>
        Habit #1. Stop beating about the bush
      </h4>
      <p>
        Get straight to the point. Seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one needs pointless introductory phrases or formalities that don&apos;t add value but add extra symbols to your
        email. You do not need to start your email with &quot;I am writing just to let you know…&quot;, I want to inform you…&quot; ,
        &quot;A short reminder about...&quot; and the like. It is an email after all, not a high school essay. As they say in
        Hollywood — cut to the chase.
      </p>


      <h4>
        Habit #2. Avoid relic, passive phrases
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It has come to my attention that...</li>
        <li>Please (kindly) be informed/advised…</li>
        <li>Please find attached…</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These phrases sound too detached and far from adding sincerity to your message. So don&apos;t waste your reader&apos;s
        time and screen space; use more modern wording, and make reading your message easy by being clear, efficient,
        and enjoyable.
      </p>

        &quot;The key is to write in a natural style as if you are having a conversation,&quot; says Shirley Taylor, the author of
        Model Business Letters, Emails and Other Business Documents.

      <h4>
        Habit #3. Refocus.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Start with them, not with yourself. Turn the flashlight on your reader to create a sound

        </a>
        Everyone is interested in themselves and cares about their goals and dreams. Your readers, as well. So shift
        your focus. Write so that the reader 1. understands you well; 2. feels important for you. These two points are a
        guarantee that your emails will be replied to.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Habit #4. Avoid long formal language
      </h4>
      <p>
        The expansion of social networks to business practices made them more personalised, customised, and, therefore,
        informal. Compare: &apos;help&apos; and &apos;assistance&apos;, or &apos;get&apos; and &apos;receive or obtain&apos;. Both &apos;help&apos; and ‘get&apos; are much
        shorter words and mean the same as their equivalents. The same story is with ‘need’ and ‘require.&apos; Informal
        language is not just shorter but also easier to read and perceived.
