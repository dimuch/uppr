      <p>Not bad, not bad at all.</p>
      <p>But there are no limits to perfection:).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here are the 4 habits you need to change to become a really effective emailer.</p>

      <h4>Habit #1. Stop beating about the bush</h4>
      <p>Get straight to the point. Seriously.</p>
      <p>
        No one needs pointless introductory phrases or formalities that don&apos;t add value but add extra symbols to
        your email. You do not need to start your email with &quot;I am writing just to let you know…&quot;, I want to
        inform you…&quot; , &quot;A short reminder about...&quot; and the like. It is an email after all, not a high
        school essay. As they say in Hollywood — cut to the chase.
      </p>

      <h4>Habit #2. Avoid relic, passive phrases</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It has come to my attention that...</li>
        <li>Please (kindly) be informed/advised…</li>
        <li>Please find attached…</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These phrases sound too detached and far from adding sincerity to your message. So don&apos;t waste your
        reader&apos;s time and screen space; use more modern wording, and make reading your message easy by being clear,
        efficient, and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;The key is to write in a natural style as if you are having a conversation,&quot; says Shirley Taylor, the
        author of Model Business Letters, Emails and Other Business Documents.
      </p>

      <h4>Habit #3. Refocus.</h4>
      <p>
        Start with them, not with yourself. Turn the flashlight on your reader to create a sound
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href={MEDIUM_LINK}>
          Reader eXperience (RX).
        </a>
        Everyone is interested in themselves and cares about their goals and dreams. Your readers, as well. So shift
        your focus. Write so that the reader 1. understands you well; 2. feels important for you. These two points are a
        guarantee that your emails will be replied to.
      </p>

      <h4>Habit #4. Avoid long formal language</h4>
      <p>
        The expansion of social networks to business practices made them more personalised, customised, and, therefore,
        informal. Compare: &apos;help&apos; and &apos;assistance&apos;, or &apos;get&apos; and &apos;receive or
        obtain&apos;. Both &apos;help&apos; and ‘get&apos; are much shorter words and mean the same as their
        equivalents. The same story is with ‘need’ and ‘require.&apos; Informal language is not just shorter but also
        easier to read and perceived.
      </p>

      <h4>Good luck and effective emails!</h4>
