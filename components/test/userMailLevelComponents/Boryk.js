        Not bad, not bad at all. But there are no limits to perfection:).

        Here are the 5 habits you need to change to become a really effective emailer.
      </p>
      

      <h4>
        Habit #1. Stop beating about the bush
      </h4>
      <p>
        Get straight to the point. Seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one needs pointless introductory phrases or formalities that don&apos;t add value but add extra symbols to your
        email. You do not need to start your email with &quot;I am writing just to let you know…&quot;, I want to inform you…&quot; ,
        &quot;A short reminder about...&quot; and the like. It is an email after all, not a high school essay or scientific
        thesis. So, as they say in Hollywood — cut to the chase.
      </p>
      

      <h4>
        Habit #2. Avoid relic, passive phrases
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It has come to my attention that...</li>
        <li>Please (kindly) be informed/advised…</li>
        <li>Please find attached…</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These phrases sound too detached and far from adding sincerity to your message, though they have been rolling
        around for decades. No one, including you, wants to spend their precious time wandering in the thickets of
        sophisticated figures of speech, pretentious mental constructions, or grey, tedious formalities. So don&apos;t waste
        your reader&apos;s time and space on the screen; use more modern wording, and make reading your message easy by being
        clear, efficient, and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;The key is to write in a natural style as if you are having a conversation,&quot; says Shirley Taylor, the author of
        Model Business Letters, Emails and Other Business Documents.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Habit #3. Refocus.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Start with them, not with yourself. Turn the flashlight on your reader to create a sound
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/@ivannatabachuk/reader-experience-rx-or-how-to-become-a-true-designer-and-an-architect-of-your-emails-2af4c386c6bc">
          Reader eXperience (RX).
        </a>
        Everyone is interested in themselves and cares about their goals and dreams. Your readers, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        So shift your focus. Write so that the reader
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>understands you well;</li>
        <li>feels important for you.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These two points are a guarantee that your emails will be replied to.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Habit #4. Avoid long formal language
      </h4>
      <p>
        The expansion of social networks to business practices made them more personalised, customised, and, therefore,
        informal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people overuse formal style; they think they will sound more competent and professional if they use more
        sophisticated words and construction. But no, they will just overload the reader and complicate what was born to
        be simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare: &apos;help&apos; and &apos;assistance&apos;, or &apos;get&apos; and &apos;receive or obtain&apos;. Both &apos;help&apos; and ‘get&apos; are much shorter words
        and mean the same as their equivalents. The same story is with ‘need’ and ‘require.&apos; Informal language is not
        just shorter but also easier to read and perceived.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Habit #5. Stop using vague Subject Lines
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your message is not the only one in your reader&apos;s inbox. A clear Subject Line can help busy professionals decide
        if the content of your email is worth their valuable time. 64% of people are reported to open an email because
        of the subject line.
      </p>
      <p>
        By writing &quot;Hello,&quot; &quot;Questions,&quot; &quot;Important&quot;, or any other bullsh*t instead of a valid subject line right from
        the start, you miss an excellent opportunity to shorten your email, as well as create an image of yourself as a
        sound professional who cares about others&apos; time. As a rule, compose a Subject Line that summarises your email
        content and limit it to 35-40 characters. Examples of effective subject lines could be &quot;Update on Company
        results in the second quarter 2023&quot;, &quot;Notes from department meeting on Payroll procedure August 2023&quot;, and &quot;A
        day off on 4 November&quot;.
